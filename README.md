# BitPredict

BitPredict is a deep learning project that predicts the price of Bitcoin based on historical data. This project utilizes TensorFlow and Google Colab to build and train machine learning models for Bitcoin price prediction.

## Introduction

The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Predicting the price of Bitcoin can be challenging, but with the power of deep learning and historical data, BitPredict aims to make accurate predictions. This project is designed for developers, data scientists, and anyone interested in exploring Bitcoin price forecasting using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook (for Google Colab)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BitPredict.git
   cd BitPredict
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `BitPredict.ipynb` notebook using Google Colab.

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load historical Bitcoin price data, preprocess the data, build and train deep learning models, and make price predictions.

3. Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data sources to fine-tune your predictions.

## Data

BitPredict relies on historical Bitcoin price data for training and testing. You can obtain this data from various sources, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, APIs, or online datasets. Please note that the quality and size of the data can significantly impact the model's performance.

## Training

Training deep learning models can be resource-intensive. Google Colab is recommended for its free GPU and TPU support, making it an ideal environment for training models. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train your model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualization techniques. Use these insights to refine your model and make more accurate predictions.
